# 3D engine using python 3.9 and tkinter

Here is a small 3d engine that I made entirely in python and tkinter for the display. All the 3d projection and camera part was made with numpy for the matrix calculations.

This small and simple engine implements the ability to project points in perspective, as well as to perform various elementary operations of translation, rotation and scaling.

It is possible to move the camera with the keys z s q d a and e by default. These keys can be modified using the .bind() method of the Engine3D class.
